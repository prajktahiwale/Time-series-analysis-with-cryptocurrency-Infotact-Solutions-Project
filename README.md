Project Name:Time series analysis with cryptocurrency

project highlights:

Objective:

To Analyze bitcoin price trends, forecast its future values and detect market anomalies.

Technique:

Time series visualization volatility analysis and predictive modeling using ARIMA,LSTM and Linear Regression.

Detailed Insights:

Model Implementation:

1.ARIMA Model: Achieved anR2 of 96.4% 
2.LSTM Model: achieved R2 score of 89.5%
3.Linear Regression: Achieved R2 score of 99.59%

Key Learnings:

ARIMA model is a forecasting tool that uses past values to predict future values of a time series.
LSTM excels in handling dynamic non linear relationship
Linear Regression emerged as a powerful solution for simpler trend forecasting.

Future Scope:

Merging ARIMA and LSTM to combine interpretability with non linear forecasting power
Including external macroeconomic factors to enhance model accuracy.
